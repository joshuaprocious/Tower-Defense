# Tower-Defense
This is a basic tower defense game. 

The reason: I couldn't find a simple tower defense game that would allow me and a few friends to just play and grind into an infinite destination; aimed at high score achievement. Flashback to when games were first hanging around like that little hungry yellow guy that was in an arcade. I want the game to be able to transport me and friends to a place of engagement and wonder. I also want it to be bulletproof and no non-sense. It should work on basic hardware. The place of continual bugs is absurd.

Dependencies: this game is packed in a virtual environment and has a requirments.txt file.
To set this up:
1. see runtime.txt for python version
1. clone repo
1. cd repo
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
1. .\venv\Scripts\activate (activate venv)
    1. deactivate (deactivate venv)
1. "python <pythonfile>.py" to run
